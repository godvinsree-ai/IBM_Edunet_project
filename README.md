Recipe Generator Application - Real-Life Description
- This is a Streamlit-based Recipe Generation Web App that uses Google's Gemini AI to create personalized recipes. Here's how it works in real life:

Real-World Use Case:
- Imagine you're at home with some leftover ingredients (chicken, broccoli, rice) and don't know what to cook. Instead of scrolling through recipe websites, you:

-- Input your ingredients - Type what you have available
-- Select preferences - Choose cuisine style (Italian, Asian, etc.), meal type (breakfast, dinner, etc.), and your hunger level
-- Get an AI-generated recipe - The app calls Google's Gemini API to create a detailed, customized recipe with:

- Recipe title and description
- Ingredient quantities
- Step-by-step cooking instructions
- Prep and cooking times
- Serving size adjusted to your hunger level
- Track your history - The app remembers all recipes you've generated

Get personalized suggestions - Based on your past recipes, it recommends new dish ideas using your favorite ingredients and cooking styles

Real-Life Benefits:
- Reduces food waste - Use ingredients you already have
- Saves time - No need to search multiple recipe sites
- Personalized - Learns your cooking preferences over time


Quick meal planning - Adjust portions based on hunger level
Inspiration - Discover new recipes based on your habits
This is perfect for busy professionals, home cooks, or anyone wanting to try new dishes without meal planning stress.
